<p class="p1">Education is a process of learning the things around you, it helps us to understand any object or situation easily, to deal with any kind of problem and to maintain balance in different dimensions throughout life.
Education is the first and prime right of all human beings. We are incomplete without education and our life is useless.
The education motivates us to set a goal in our life and move forward. It improves our knowledge, skills, confidence and personality.
It enhances the intellectual ability to talk to others in our lives. Education brings maturity and teaches us to live in the changing environment of society.
